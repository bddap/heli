This cute little "helicopter" game uses [hecs](https://github.com/Ralith/hecs) for ecs and [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) for everything else. Arrow keys or WASD to move, Q or escape to exit.

# Setup

You'll need the Rust toolchain if you don't have it already. https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started

On Windows or Mac that should be all (please open an issue otherwise).

On linux you'll need a few `lib****-dev`s. https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad#linux

# To Run

```
cargo run --release
```
